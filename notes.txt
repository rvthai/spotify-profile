Top Genres Algorithm (since Spotify does not provide an API endpoint for this feature):
1. Get top 50 tracks per range (depending on range user wants to see)
2. For each track, extract the artist and add it to a list if not yet added 
3. For each artist in that list and count the total occurences of each genre
4. Get the top ten most listened genres from that list
5. Sum up the occurences from the top ten and calculate the percentages/porportions for a pie chart
