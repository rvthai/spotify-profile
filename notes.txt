-----------------------------------------------

Main info per user:
- top tracks
- top artists
- top genres (need to come up with own algorithm)

Pages:
- Login Screen
- Home/Profile 
- Top Tracks 
- Top Artists 
- Top Genres 
- Sign out page*
* Most likely going to be a button

-----------------------------------------------
Top Genres Algorithm (since Spotify does not provide an API endpoint for this feature):
1. Get top 50 tracks per range (depending on range user wants to see)
2. For each track, extract the artist and add it to a list if not yet added 
3. For each artist in that list and count the total occurences of each genre
4. Get the top ten most listened genres from that list
5. Sum up the occurences from the top ten and calculate the percentages/porportions for a pie chart

Authorization, Refresh Tokens, Login and Logout Algorithm:
1. Get the token from hash params
2. If there is an error or token has expired (i can hardset a time frame), then refresh the access token and store in local storage
3. If local storage is missing any tokens (access or refresh) set it with the hash params value
4. Get and return the local access token to be used 
5. On sign out, just clear local storage of all tokens and reload the page\
